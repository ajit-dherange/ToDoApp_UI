# ToDoApp_UI
ToDoApp_UI (Nodejs)

## Getting Started with Create React App (For EC2)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

1. Install NodeJs 16.x and NPM on Ubuntu
2. Update the backend URL in the src/TodoApp.js
3. Run npm install
4. RUn npm run build
5. Copy the Generated artifacts in nginx server

## Create container image (for Kubernates ... docker file is present with codes)

To create a Docker container image from your Node.js code, assuming you already have the Dockerfile in place, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Node.js application and the Dockerfile.
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```
2. Build the Docker image: Use the docker build command to build the Docker image. Make sure you're in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
```
$ docker build -t your-image-name .

Replace your-image-name with the name you want for your image. EX: docker build -t todoapp .
The . at the end specifies the current directory as the build context. If your Dockerfile is located elsewhere, replace . with the appropriate path.
```
3. Verify the image: Once the build is complete, you can check if the image was created successfully using the docker images command:
```
docker images

This will list all the Docker images on your local machine, including the one you just built.
```
4. Run the Docker container: After the image is built, you can run it as a container using the docker run command:
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-image-name

The -p 3000:3000 flag maps port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 inside the container. Modify these port numbers if your application uses different ports.
Replace your-image-name with the actual name you assigned to the image. EX: docker run -p 3000:3000 todoapp
Access the Node.js application: If the Node.js application is running on port 3000, you can access it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser or API client.
```
### Summary of commands:
``` 
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t todoapp .

# Verify the image is created
docker images

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 todoapp
or
docker run -P --name todoapp-con todoapp
```
